In the wake of the Kansas shootings, Michael Bloomberg's $50 million gun control effort, \"Everytown for Gun Safety,\" unveiled its first ad. We \"have another chance to stop a child from being killed,\" it said. We do, but only if we refuse to lower our expectations.

Actually, that was what he said after Newtown, several mass shootings ago. This time the president was, rightfully, angrier and wearier. \"I've had to make statements like this too many times,\" he said, noting that \"at some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.\" That reckoning should happen now -- right now -- even as the Confederate flag continues to shamefully fly at full mast above the South Carolina state house\".",

These heinous attacks were, in essence, aimed at tolerance, openness, dialogue, and diversity -- and are more a test of our commitment to our most bedrock principles than a test of our security capabilities. The way to pass this test is by refusing to compromise those core values. I'd also like to salute our colleagues at Le Huffington Post in Paris, who did a stellar job covering the tragic and rapidly shifting story. It's been a grim few days, but as today's march of solidarity in Paris will no doubt show, what unites us is much more powerful than the forces of division and intolerance."
