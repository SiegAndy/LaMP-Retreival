        "Article: \"This week all eyes were on Paris as the murderous shooting at the offices of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, which left 12 dead, culminated in two simultaneous hostage crises in which the Hedbo attackers and four hostages were killed. These heinous attacks were, in essence, aimed at tolerance, openness, dialogue, and diversity -- and are more a test of our commitment to our most bedrock principles than a test of our security capabilities. The way to pass this test is by refusing to compromise those core values. I'd also like to salute our colleagues at Le Huffington Post in Paris, who did a stellar job covering the tragic and rapidly shifting story. It's been a grim few days, but as today's march of solidarity in Paris will no doubt show, what unites us is much more powerful than the forces of division and intolerance\".
